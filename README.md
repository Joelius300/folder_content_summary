# Folder content summary

A tiny script that summarizes the files inside a folder (including subfolder)
and outputs the file's path, SHA256 hashsum, last modified date and size (in bytes) to a csv.

The motivation for this project is comparing multiple different folders on different system
without having to have access to both folders at the same time. This can be used for example
to try to scrap together files from multiple different systems to restore a wiped cloud.

## Usage

```shell
cd to/your/folder
python to/this/repo/summarize_folder.py
```
